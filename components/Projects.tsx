    description:
      "AutoNexus is a full-stack, end-to-end AutoML and Explainable AI (XAI) platform I developed to make data science accessible and transparent. Featuring a secure Firebase authentication system, the app guides users through a professional machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, automated hyperparameter tuning, and deep model interpretation with SHAP and LIME. To enhance the user experience, the platform features a context-aware AI assistant, powered by Google's Gemini, that provides conversational guidance throughout the data science lifecycle.",

      "Developed a classification pipeline to predict loan defaults using Random Forest with SMOTE for class imbalance. Focused on model transparency by applying SHAP, LIME, and DiCE-ML to explain predictions and generate counterfactuals. Evaluated fairness across protected attributes using AIF360 and Fairlearn, and visualized global feature impacts using ALE and PDP plots. Achieved high recall on minority class while ensuring model interpretability and ethical compliance.",
