    description:
      "AutoNexus is a powerful Streamlit web app that automates the entire data pipeline â€” from uploading raw CSVs to cleaning, exploring, modeling, and explaining results. Users can perform missing value handling, feature scaling, categorical encoding, and visualize EDA insights with real-time plots. It also supports exportable datasets, and model explainability with SHAP, EBM, and LIME. Built for data scientists and analysts who want faster insights without the overhead of manual coding.",

    description:
      "Developed a classification pipeline to predict loan defaults using Random Forest with SMOTE for class imbalance. Focused on model transparency by applying SHAP, LIME, and DiCE-ML to explain predictions and generate counterfactuals. Evaluated fairness across protected attributes using AIF360 and Fairlearn, and visualized global feature impacts using ALE and PDP plots. Achieved high recall on minority class while ensuring model interpretability and ethical compliance.",
