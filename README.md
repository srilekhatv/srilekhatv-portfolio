Hi! I'm **Srilekha Tirumala Vinjamoori** ‚Äî a data analyst and ML enthusiast with a passion for storytelling through data. This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my work, academic journey, and the projects that have shaped my learning.

The design of this website is inspired by the beautiful portfolio created by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com), and the open-source version by [Alexander Meikopoulos](https://meikopoulos.com). I‚Äôve personalized it to reflect my journey, while acknowledging and crediting their amazing work.
